# My Computer Scripts
This is a collection of some of the scripts I have on my computer. I use these to automate, or make easier, a variety of tasks. They're generally manually launched using rofi/drun and the "launcher" folder, although some are launched by local . Each script is generally annotated with a comment at the top, explaining what it is for.
